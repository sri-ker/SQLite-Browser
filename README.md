# SQLite-Browser
*SQLite Brwoser* is an application with GUI for browsing SQLite database files and do manipulations. Other than normal features, one module is developed to filter and select data with regular expression.
This software is written with Python, and GUI is implemented with Tkinter library.

## Features

#### Brwosing
This application is designed mainly for browsing the tables in SQLite database files (.db), instead of doing this with command line.

#### Exporting & Imporing
This application also enables you to export the tables in .db files into .CSV files, as well as import tables into .db files from .CSV files.

#### Executing SQL Query
A window is provided in this application in case that you need to execute any SQL commands to manipulate the tables and .db files. This grants this software "full" features of SQLite.

#### Regular Expression Filter
Users can filter a table with regular expression. 

## Installation
