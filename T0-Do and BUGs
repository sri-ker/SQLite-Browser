If I drop a table in the SQL execution module, the table list and the number of tables can't be updated correspondingly.


[Already addressed]: in the status module, to have this feature: if the file size is small, use “bytes”. If it’s big, use “MB”. automatically.

if i’m writing into one database (.db), I can’t use this app to open it. Error “database is locked” will be returned. This app should have a reminding message to tell user that it’s locked instating of showing a blank window.

when i choose a table, only first 30 rows will be showed but all rows will be selected. This will slow down the app. Can only select first 30 rows and show them, and select all when click “view all“
